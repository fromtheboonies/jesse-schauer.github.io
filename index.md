I’m Jesse Schauer — Master Software Engineer, business-minded fixer, and the merc that gets called in to get stuff done.

I fix what others can’t (or won’t) — keeping critical systems online, efficient, and maintainable.

With a Master’s in Software Engineering and a Bachelor’s in Business Management, I bridge the gap between technical debt and business impact.

Whether it’s stabilizing a broken benefits platform, automating years of manual processes, or mentoring junior devs while shipping production code — I handle the work others avoid.

Let’s be honest — sometimes you don’t need a team.  
You just need someone who knows where to aim.
