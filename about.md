I’m Jesse Schauer — a Master Software Engineer with a business background and a results-first mindset.

I’ve spent the past 14+ years stabilizing critical systems, streamlining operations, and stepping into roles nobody else wanted to own. I’m usually brought in when things are breaking, unclear, or just plain stuck — and I get them moving again.

I don’t just write code. I often act as my own PM, BA, and Dev — designing, implementing, and delivering under real-world constraints. I’ve worked on benefit platforms, corrections systems, healthcare modules, and more. I understand what’s at stake when public systems fail — and I take that seriously.

With a Master’s in Software Engineering and a B.S. in Business Management, I bring both the technical chops *and* the operational awareness to solve high-impact problems without spinning wheels.

### I Believe:

- **Results > Rituals** – I’m not here for sprint theater. I’m here to ship solutions.
- **Pragmatism wins** – I balance long-term maintainability with short-term urgency.
- **Public systems deserve quality too** – even if they weren’t built that way.
- **Documentation matters** – because no one wants to inherit chaos.

## A Bit More About Me

### Why legacy systems?

Because I’ve seen what happens when they fail.  
There were times in my life when I relied on public support systems — rent help, food stamps, and student loans. I’ve had friends caught in the justice system and an ex-wife whose addiction derailed both our lives. These systems matter more than people realize — until they don’t work.

I bring stability to code that affects real people. Not just because it’s a challenge — but because I’ve lived what’s at stake.

### What’s your style?

Low ego. High output results.  
I don’t need meetings to prove I’m working — you’ll see it in the commits, the results, and the lack of fires. I document obsessively, automate where I can, and treat every project like someone else will inherit it tomorrow (because someone usually does).

### What do you do outside of code?

Try to be the best Dad and Husband I can be.

I run a small 3D printing side business, designed and built my own home theater, and finished my entire basement (among many other DIY projects) from YouTube University.

I’m the kind of guy who 3D prints custom knick-knacks for the team and delivers smoked Chex Mix by the pound.

I’ve had the privilege of helping multiple states stabilize or modernize systems when it mattered. I like building trust — not just code.

One agency even sent flowers to my wife and me when our second daughter was born. That kind of relationship doesn’t come from pushing tickets — it comes from showing up, solving real problems, and treating people like partners.

If you’re still reading, you might just be my kind of people.
